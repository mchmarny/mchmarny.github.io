In short, we often view PaaS as a runtime execution engine that trivialize the complex aspects of application development and deployment.\nThe problem with that kind of view however is that it focus primarily on the run-time aspects of the platform. This may be a result of some vendors treating data services as an external concern, strapped onto the platform as an add-on, almost as an afterthought. Heroku, for example, provides only Postgres as their one “native” data service, while OpenShift does slightly better, adds MySQL and a community supported edition of MongoDB.\nEveryone would agree that add-ons play an important role in the extendibility of any PaaS solution.

As many of you know, I work for VMware, which initiated open source PaaS solution called Cloud Foundry.\nRight now, Cloud Foundry delivers the richest selection of native data services on the market, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RabitMQ and a couple different versions of Redis.\nThese services deliver predictable, low-latency connectivity to your data whether your application is deployed to the public instance of Cloud Foundry operated by VMware, AWS instance operated by one of our ecosystem partners like AppFog, or to a private instance running out of your own data center. Whichever Cloud Foundry instance your application targets, that data service provisioned by Cloud Foundry will behave exactly the same.\nHowever, it would be naïve to expect all necessary data services to always be available natively. Just for these kinds of situations, Cloud Foundry provides an open source Service Broker (yes, service extending a service), which delivers the very same provisioning characteristics to external or legacy services, which are currently not offered by Cloud Foundry. The best part is that these services can be managed through the same API and benefit from the very same native integration into your application.\nIn short, if application mobility is important to you, please view data services as an intrinsic part of your PaaS strategy.\nAdd-ons are great and certainly appropriate in many cases; just make sure they don’t become your gateway drug locking your application to specific provider.\n","wordCount":"506","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://blog.chmarny.com/images/site-feature-image.png","datePublished":"2015-01-05T00:30:56.682Z","dateModified":"2015-01-05T00:30:56.682Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mark Chmarny"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/paas-not-just-about-runtime-data-services-are-the-next-differentiator/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mark Chmarny","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.chmarny.com/favicons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.chmarny.com/ accesskey=h title="Mark Chmarny (Alt + H)">Mark Chmarny</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
