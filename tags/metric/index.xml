That dataset gets significantly larger when you add things like license scanning and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom"&gt;Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt; (SBOM) generation. That volume of data gets further compounded with each highly-automated pipeline you operate. This can quickly lead to what I refer to as a Software Supply Chain Security (S3C) data fatigue, as many vulnerabilities you’ll discover you simply can’t do anything about. There is an actionable signal in there actually, it’s just hard to find it in the midst of all the noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Vision of smarter thingz - project in adaptive metric flow modeling</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/vision-of-smarter-thingz-project-in-adaptive-metric-flow-modeling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:43:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/vision-of-smarter-thingz-project-in-adaptive-metric-flow-modeling/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the holidays, as many of us do, I embarked on a little extra-curriculum development effort I called &lt;a href="http://thingz.io"&gt;thingz.io&lt;/a&gt;. I was driven by the pattern I’d observed in Data Center (DC) monitoring products; although that pattern also exists in many of today’s Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
