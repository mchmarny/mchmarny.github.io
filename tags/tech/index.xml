Developers entering the market today use different tools and follow different patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core patterns of on-line application development today is cloud scale design. While traditionally architectures would rely on more powerful servers, today, that approach simply does not scale. We have reached that point where, in many cases, there are no powerful enough servers, or their cost would be prohibitive. Considering the unpredictable usage patterns today’s on-line applications also must be flexible to address demand spikes and assure efficient service during low utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
