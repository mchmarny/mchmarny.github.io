You trust that the person behind the commit is who they claim to be, that their account hasn&amp;rsquo;t been compromised, and that their contribution is genuine. Most of the time, that trust is warranted. But supply chain attacks like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor"&gt;xz utils backdoor&lt;/a&gt; remind us that trust without verification is a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reproducible OpenID connect to GCR for GitHub Actions workflows using Terraform</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/reproducible-github-workflow-openid-connect-for-gcp-using-terraform/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 16:12:38 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/reproducible-github-workflow-openid-connect-for-gcp-using-terraform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The recently introduced by GitHub support for &lt;a href="https://openid.net/connect/"&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/a&gt; (OIDC) tokens in &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; allows workflows to mint new tokens and then exchange those tokens for short-lived OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to access and manage Cloud resources. This is all done without the need to store the traditional long-lived service account keys in a form of GitHub secrets.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Multi Region REST Service on GCP using GitHub Template</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/multi-region-rest-service-on-gcp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 15:43:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/multi-region-rest-service-on-gcp/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I learn best by doing. And recently, most of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been building are either REST or gRPC-base services deployed as container images into Cloud Run on GCP. That means that I increasingly find myself recreating a lot of the same infra and app deployment flows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Medium to GitHub using Hugo - Why and How I Migrated my Blog</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/medium-to-hugo-why-and-how/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/medium-to-hugo-why-and-how/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-not-medium"&gt;Why not Medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main reason for migrating off Medium was the &lt;a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017581433-About-the-metered-paywall"&gt;paywall&lt;/a&gt; Medium introduced while back. I actually understand why they did it. The unlimited access price: $5/month ($50/year) is too high, but still, I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me though, the objective was to allow readers to easily discover and read my posts. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my readers to experience any friction. Forcing the reader to deal with the frustrating Medium up-sell pop-ups just to read my post was just unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Custom news scraper using free services from GitHub, Firebase, and Sengrid</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/custom-news-scraper-using-free-services-from-github-firebase-sengrid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 01:09:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/custom-news-scraper-using-free-services-from-github-firebase-sengrid/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing large amount of technical news I read come from the posts shared on Hacker News or on Twitter. While both of these services have &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-advanced-search"&gt;search options&lt;/a&gt;, neither of these seem to be advanced enough to narrow my searches at the desired level or to setup automatic delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
