The conference has double its audience from last year, had a spectacular venue, and large selection of topics. I spoke in the #serverless track on using Knative as a means to serverless where you want it and on your own terms. Stressing the importance of portability and demonstrating the key features that the Kantive community has already delivered.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Build and manage modern serverless workloads using Knative on Kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/build-modern-serverless-workloads-using-knative-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 16:05:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/build-modern-serverless-workloads-using-knative-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By now, &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; should be the default target for your deployments.

I’m not a big fan of that city myself, but, as in previous years, re:invent has not disappointed. Much coverage has been dedicated to the newly introduced services; I won’t bore you with that.
