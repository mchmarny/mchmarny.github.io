I had the opportunity to attend Google Next this year. Week after this event I joined Google. Here are some quick notes in no particular order:

* Registration was a pain, long lines. My first tech conference where I had to go through a metal detector.
* Impressive reminder of the core tech underlining Google Cloud (i.e. [Borg](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43438.pdf)) and Google’s experience in operating at scale.
* Serious commitment to ML and Data Science: invest in talent/community ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)), vision/leadership ([Fei-Fei Li keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgqgdddl018)), powerful [APIs](https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/) (i.e. Label/Face Detection, OCR, Explicit Content etc.)
* Feels like the ease of use for Google is more important than time time market (see the above DS APIs but also Spanner UX).
* Clear understanding of data economy’s potential value (goes with the scale comment but the experience was apparent in many sessions/keynotes)
* Open/partner market makes stronger platform ([Sam Ramji’s keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9FSqVbdHis&index=7&list=PLIivdWyY5sqI8RuUibiH8sMb1ExIw0lAR) drilled on this best), early hints of this were probably the main reason why I wanted to join Google Cloud team.
* Size/quality of the network (both, cables & tech), globally distributed data systems (specifically latency) are perhaps the best example of the user value here.
