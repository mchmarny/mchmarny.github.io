This is one of those posts you write on your phone while getting sprayed for 11+ hours with bathroom chemicals in minimally reclining seat in a second to last row of a transatlantic flight. Still, I’m going to try to be as constructive as my thumbs allow.

Let me back up… when booking ticket for my business trip to Poland recently, I realized that part of the flight was operated by Lufthansa; flagship Star Alliance member. I wasn’t able to select seats on couple of their flights during initial booking but I figured, no big deal, it’s 2016, I will go to Lufthansa site and select them there. This is where the fun started.

I figured, ok, maybe this is a low end ticket or something, let me try to pay for an upgrade.

When I called the airline directly I was told that **“Lufthansa does not recognize United status”** and those seats are “locked” anyway so they can’t do anything for me. The shift supervisor however, after some lengthy wait, did tell me she was able to assign me a seat closer forward (63G). And, since the seats will be “unlocked” 24 hours before flight anyway I should just come back then and pick any available seat I want.

As you suspect by now, when I checked-in at PDX, the seat was still 93G. I quickly dialed Lufthansa support desk only to be told, again, that:

> “Lufthansa does not recognized United status” — Lufthansa Agent

I asked to talk to supervisor because surely there must be some kind of notes in my travel record. Just for that assumption I was given a lovely dose of the ear-pleasing tunes for 20+ min only to be finally disconnected without any notice.

Upon arrival in SFO I inquired again with the gate agent. He told me to come back at 14:30, an hour before the flight, when the manager is there. As you can imagine, when I came back the manager told me all the seats are already booked. He was gracious enough to move me however to a mcuh “better seat” upstairs. I’m thinking at this point, upstairs on A380–800, sure, anything will be better than 93G. He even ushered me quickly through the boarding procedures.

When I boarded I realized this was the exact same seat I had before... just upstairs. Still just as minimally reclining and just as close to the bathroom.

I expected more from world’s largest global airline alliance. That whole experience made me question the value of Star Alliance. What are the actual benefits? Yes, those 11+ hours of chemical spray I suppose did get me more United miles. I also know you can check bags all the way to your destination… not much of a value to me on my business travels, but sure, let’s go with that. Is that it? Shouldn’t we expect more?

> Even with my 1K status on United I got less love from Lufthansa than I would if I actually bought my ticket directly. I expected much better from flagship Star Alliance member.
