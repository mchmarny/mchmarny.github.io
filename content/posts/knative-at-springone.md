I had an opportunity to keynote at this yearâ€™s [SpringOne](https://springoneplatform.io/2018/speakers/mark-chmarny) conference in DC on Serverless, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and more specifically [Knative](https://cloud.google.com/knative/).

I also covered the great work our open source team at Google been doing, making Spring 1st class citizen on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKmp9xbKiso&list=PLAdzTan_eSPQsR_aqYBQxpYTEQZnjhTN6&index=7))

On a personal level, it was good to reconnect with some old friends from [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io/), and, community at large.
