Next week, April 9–11, Google will be hosting this year’s [**Cloud Next Conference**](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf) in San Francisco. The conference is already sold out, but there will be a [livestream](https://youtu.be/WPfyjzgBEJU%29%20youtu.be/WPfyjzgBEJU) from keynotes and video available shortly after the sessions.

This year, we have a lot of content to share, and I have the privilege of presenting in [four sessions](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/speakers?speaker=2278AB79A813FD48) — and hope to do at least six live demos.

On Tuesday, April 10 at 12:35 PM, [Donna Malayeri](https://twitter.com/lindydonna) and I will be overviewing the integration options developers have on GCP when building serverless solutions on Kubernetes:

> Kubernetes provides a great platform for operators, but what about your developers? Dive into the details about a new GCP product powered by Knative and Kubernetes Engine that enables enterprise developers to build and deploy stateless containerized apps into a cluster without writing any YAML.

Then on Thursday, April 11 at 9 AM, [Tomas Isdal](https://twitter.com/isdal) and I will give an update on [Knative](https://www.knative.dev/) and the fascinating momentum this project has had since we announced it at this same event the previous year:

[**Knative a Year Later: Serverless, Kubernetes and You (video)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvuqSTVXSQA)

> Knative, which provides the technology for a serverless developer experience on Kubernetes, has seen remarkable growth and uptake since launching in 2018. Join Google to hear how we are delivering Knative-based products to customers in 2019.

At 11:40 AM, [Ryan Gregg](https://twitter.com/ryangregg) and I will host a session overving the consistent developer experience enabled by Google on Kubernetes:

[**Run a Consistent Serverless Platform Anywhere with Kubernetes and Knative (video)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb_bRRAgEyc)

> Come learn about the latest Google Cloud offering that brings the best of serverless to your GKE cluster and anywhere you can run Kubernetes. Learn how Knative and GCP provide a consistent developer experience for new apps across cloud, on-prem and hybrid. Where you choose to run your services should be your choice!

I’m super excited for Google Cloud Next, and am looking forward to these sessions. If you are in San Francisco next week, I hope to see you there.
