I am excited to share with you today that starting Monday I will be joining the Big Data team at [Intel](http://www.intel.com/&t=YjBkOTU4OTE0ZjlmMGI5YmQ4MTNlMWE0NzUwMGE3MmQwODdmNzRjNCxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D). Yes, Intel. While not traditionally known for its software offerings, Intel has recently entered the Big Data space by introducing their own, [100% open source Hadoop distribution](http://hadoop.intel.com/&t=OGIwNmNhMjhlMDk1Y2IzODIyMmEyYWZkYjRmMmI4YTFhZjUwN2UyMyxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D) with unique security and monitoring features.

As illustrated by their [Github repository](https://github.com/intel-hadoop&t=ZjRlMWMzY2FkYjZiYTJiZWI0ZWFkY2JjZDk5ZWM5NDMxYWM1MjYwNixJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D), Intel has already done a lot of work with [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/&t=YzcxOTFjNmE3MDAzNDUyY2VlMzdkZjdkZjc2MjMxYmQ0YTYwYjYzYixJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D). The particular repos worth mentioning are their work on [HBase’s](http://hbase.apache.org/&t=N2M0ZDU2OGViNjdlMTY3NjY2OTI3ODhiZmVhMDJlNjMyZTZkNTgwNCxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D) security in [Project Rhino](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/project-rhino&t=MmQ5MWMxNDI1MjEzZjU2MWE3NGRjMjZlZmEwNjg2MWI2MTFiOGNjMixJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D) as well as their work on advanced SQL support in Hive and performance enhancements for HBase in [Project Panthera](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/project-panthera&t=ODMxY2M4NDBiYzc2ZGE3NzBiZGFjZjI0NTgxNmIwNzdkYmQ3YmJmNixJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D). In addition to these projects, Intel has also established [Benchmarking Suite](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiBench&t=ZGUzOGRjMWJjZmY4MzcyNzEyNDdiMGY4YzU1NDgzZjQzNmEwYTFmOSxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D) and [Performance Analyzer](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/HiTune&t=NzMzNmQ4MjM4OTQyZTM2MmE3Mzc3YTJkY2RiZTg3YmMzYWZkZmJlZCxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D) projects which aim to standardize measurements around real-life Hadoop workloads.

As a solution architect, I will work on a team dedicated to designing the next-generation data analytics platform by leveraging the full breadth of Intel’s infrastructure experience with compute ([Xeon processor](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-processor-e7-family.html&t=NmI4MTAzMjFjMjUwNGY3ZWQ1ZjA3ZWRhMGNjZTJiYTM2MWU5MTFhZCxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D)), storage ([Intel SSD](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/solid-state-drives-ssd.html&t=YjVmNjkwNjFhODQ4OTdiYTIxNjU2OWM1Yjc1MTI5OWEyOTVmNzk4YixJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D)), and networking ([Intel 10GbE](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/network-adapters/converged-network-adapters.html&t=ZjM3ZWNjNGYyMTQwZmU5YjBmY2VhMmZiM2Y3OGZlNmYxZDMwMzQ4ZSxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D)), as well as its cryptographic and compression technologies ([AES-NI](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-advanced-encryption-standard-instructions-aes-ni&t=MmM0MjJlYjNmNjU4NmViM2ViMjQ2ZDViZmI3YmVkNDUxMWY1MDMyZCxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D), [SSE](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-streaming-simd-extensions-and-intel-integrated-performance-primitives-to-accelerate-algorithms&t=NjBjYjJjOTY0NWUxMWMyMWZlMWQ0YTlkNmU1OGVlNDcxYTU2NGU4YSxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D)).

## Why Intel

If you have read [my blog](http://m.chmarny.com/) over the last couple of years, you will [know how passionate I am about data](/posts/3-killer-big-data-app-opportunities.md). I believe Apache Hadoop specifically represents a very unique opportunity for the enterprise as it challenges many preconceived notions about analytics, both from the scale as well as cost perspective.

> My vision for Hadoop is for it to become a truly viable data platform: open, easy and performant.

A platform upon which the community can innovate and solve real complex problems. I joined Intel because it provides me the means to execute on this very vision. After all, Intel’s Hadoop distribution is the only open source platform backed by a Fortune 100 company.
