We are entering a period where custom, highly-optimized, vertical solutions are becoming viable option again. This is a good news for ISVs with proven domain expertise and skilled development resources.

Why do I think so? We now have:

1. Plethora of feature-rich developer frameworks, message queues, scalable data stores, and even lower-level components in the OSS community with great documentation and a large number of use-case validation
2. Growing number of custom solution companies (more than just ISVs) with existing deep vertical/domain expertise who are also increasingly now investing in hiring and training strong development teams
3. Virtually every Cloud provider offering either a raw Kubernetes service or managed container execution platform which (regardless how you feel about these technologies) creates ubiquitous surface area that can be addressed with a single solution

Yes, there still are many ways in which these custom development efforts can fail. Still, as one who has started their professional career developing custom software, Iâ€™m glad to see how these kinds of efforts are becoming cost effective again and increasingly represent a viable option for differentiation and real business value delivery.

Keep an eye on vertically-focused companies like (just to name a few) NCR or Manhattan Associates in retail, Schlumberger or OSI Soft in energy, or Siemens and Rockwell Automation in manufacturing. The renaissance of custom vertical solution is coming.
