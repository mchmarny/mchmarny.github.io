You trust that the person behind the commit is who they claim to be, that their account hasn&amp;rsquo;t been compromised, and that their contribution is genuine. Most of the time, that trust is warranted. But supply chain attacks like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor"&gt;xz utils backdoor&lt;/a&gt; remind us that trust without verification is a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About Mark Chmarny</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Builder, architect, and strategist dedicated to simplifying how developers interact with complex systems.

When I joined the company seven months ago, my mission was to scale the AV services worldwide and to modernize the AV and Cloud service developer platforms. Despite the unexpected challenges following the &lt;a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2024/cruise-releases-third-party-findings-regarding-october-2/"&gt;October incident&lt;/a&gt;, my journey at Cruise has been incredibly enriching, teaching me the true essence of resilience, adaptability, and commitment to excellence.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Provenance, transparency, and context, the three aspects of software supply chain security you can implement today</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/provenance-transparency-context-3-aspects-of-s3c-you-can-implement-today/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 08:57:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/provenance-transparency-context-3-aspects-of-s3c-you-can-implement-today/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The practice of Secure Software Supply Chain (S3C) can get complex at times.

That dataset gets significantly larger when you add things like license scanning and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom"&gt;Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt; (SBOM) generation. That volume of data gets further compounded with each highly-automated pipeline you operate. This can quickly lead to what I refer to as a Software Supply Chain Security (S3C) data fatigue, as many vulnerabilities you’ll discover you simply can’t do anything about. There is an actionable signal in there actually, it’s just hard to find it in the midst of all the noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Twitter follower status monitoring made easy using TweeThingz</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/twitter-follower-activity-monitoring-using-tweethingz/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 09:13:38 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/twitter-follower-activity-monitoring-using-tweethingz/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" src="https://blog.chmarny.com/images/twitter-api-access.jpeg" style="width:300px; height:auto; margin:20px" /&gt;Twitter does provide notifications for when new users start following you.

&lt;p&gt;My main reason for migrating off Medium was the &lt;a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017581433-About-the-metered-paywall"&gt;paywall&lt;/a&gt; Medium introduced while back. I actually understand why they did it. The unlimited access price: $5/month ($50/year) is too high, but still, I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me though, the objective was to allow readers to easily discover and read my posts. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my readers to experience any friction. Forcing the reader to deal with the frustrating Medium up-sell pop-ups just to read my post was just unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Search Posts</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/search/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/search/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Custom news scraper using free services from GitHub, Firebase, and Sengrid</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/custom-news-scraper-using-free-services-from-github-firebase-sengrid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 01:09:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/custom-news-scraper-using-free-services-from-github-firebase-sengrid/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing large amount of technical news I read come from the posts shared on Hacker News or on Twitter.

This reductionist statements misses nuance around the inherent cost/benefit tradeoffs, especially when you consider these over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, there often are good reasons for additional layers to make things simpler (grow adoption, lowering toil, removing friction, etc.). Still, these layers come at the long-term cost that’s often is not a part of the evaluation process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I learned Dapr building tweet sentiment processing pipeline</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-i-learned-dapr-building-tweet-sentiment-processing-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:05:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-i-learned-dapr-building-tweet-sentiment-processing-pipeline/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently joined the Office of CTO in Azure at Microsoft and wanted to ramp up on one of the open source projects the team has built there called Dapr.

This is a good news for ISVs with proven domain expertise and skilled development resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I think so? We now have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plethora of feature-rich developer frameworks, message queues, scalable data stores, and even lower-level components in the OSS community with great documentation and a large number of use-case validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing number of custom solution companies (more than just ISVs) with existing deep vertical/domain expertise who are also increasingly now investing in hiring and training strong development teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually every Cloud provider offering either a raw Kubernetes service or managed container execution platform which (regardless how you feel about these technologies) creates ubiquitous surface area that can be addressed with a single solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there still are many ways in which these custom development efforts can fail. Still, as one who has started their professional career developing custom software, I’m glad to see how these kinds of efforts are becoming cost effective again and increasingly represent a viable option for differentiation and real business value delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to debug container image content</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-debug-container-image-content/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 22:20:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-debug-container-image-content/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When dealing with file permissions in a non-root image or building apps that include static content (like css or templates), I sometime get an error resulting from the final image content mismatch with my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

These button caught my attention because they can include triggers for single, double, or hold click and can be easily wired up to all kinds of actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I instantly thought of of a few really interesting applications. To start with though, I wanted to create a simple service that would allow me to push the custom data defined on each button over HTTP to Cloud PubSub. That in turn would then connect me to the many more actuation options through GCP APIs and services that connect to Cloud PugSub.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>My Sessions at Google Next 2019</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/my-sessions-at-google-next-2019/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 16:30:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/my-sessions-at-google-next-2019/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Next week, April 9–11, Google will be hosting this year’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Next Conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco.

&lt;p&gt;The main value of Kubernetes is that it greatly abstracts much of the infrastructure management pain. The broad support amongst virtually all major Cloud Service Providers (CSP) also means that your workloads are portable. Combined with the already vibrant ecosystem of Kubernetes-related tools, means that the experience of the operator, the person responsible for managing Kubernetes, is now pretty smooth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to use Stackdriver to monitor custom application metrics</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-use-stackdriver-to-monitor-custom-application-metrics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2017 22:08:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-use-stackdriver-to-monitor-custom-application-metrics/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/"&gt;Stackdriver&lt;/a&gt; has thousands of build-in metrics to monitor everything from Kubernetes cluster to database or storage.

Week after this event I joined Google. Here are some quick notes in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registration was a pain, long lines. My first tech conference where I had to go through a metal detector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impressive reminder of the core tech underlining Google Cloud (i.e. &lt;a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43438.pdf"&gt;Borg&lt;/a&gt;) and Google’s experience in operating at scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serious commitment to ML and Data Science: invest in talent/community (&lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;), vision/leadership (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgqgdddl018"&gt;Fei-Fei Li keynote&lt;/a&gt;), powerful &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/"&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. Label/Face Detection, OCR, Explicit Content etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feels like the ease of use for Google is more important than time time market (see the above DS APIs but also Spanner UX).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear understanding of data economy’s potential value (goes with the scale comment but the experience was apparent in many sessions/keynotes)&lt;/li&gt;

Yes, Intel. While not traditionally known for its software offerings, Intel has recently entered the Big Data space by introducing their own, &lt;a href="http://hadoop.intel.com/&amp;amp;t=OGIwNmNhMjhlMDk1Y2IzODIyMmEyYWZkYjRmMmI4YTFhZjUwN2UyMyxJVHRWNTZwQw%3D%3D"&gt;100% open source Hadoop distribution&lt;/a&gt; with unique security and monitoring features.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>HDFS has won, now de facto standard for centralized data storage</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/hdfs-has-won-de-facto-standard-for-centralized-data-storage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:28:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/hdfs-has-won-de-facto-standard-for-centralized-data-storage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;high-priests&amp;rdquo; of Big Data have spoken.

You may have heard this &amp;ldquo;heresy&amp;rdquo; uttered before. But, for me, it wasn’t until the recent &lt;a href="http://mark.chmarny.com/2012/10/stratahadoop-world-2012-etl-sql-other.html"&gt;Strata conference&lt;/a&gt; that I began to really understand how prevalent this opinion actually is.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don't use yesterday's database to develop tomorrow's solutions</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/dont-use-yesterday-database-to-develop-tomorrow-solutions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:26:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/dont-use-yesterday-database-to-develop-tomorrow-solutions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We are in a midst of drastic shift in application development landscape. Developers entering the market today use different tools and follow different patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core patterns of on-line application development today is cloud scale design. While traditionally architectures would rely on more powerful servers, today, that approach simply does not scale. We have reached that point where, in many cases, there are no powerful enough servers, or their cost would be prohibitive. Considering the unpredictable usage patterns today’s on-line applications also must be flexible to address demand spikes and assure efficient service during low utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Data-related investments shift from tech to skills — talent new differentiator</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/data-related-investments-shift-from-tech-to-skills-talent-new-differentiator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:24:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/data-related-investments-shift-from-tech-to-skills-talent-new-differentiator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, the access to best-of-bread data technologies has become easier.

In large, my decision was based on Intel’s desire to address the &amp;ldquo;voodoo magic&amp;rdquo; in Big Data: the complexities that require deep technical skills which are preventing domain experts from gaining access to large volumes of data. The idea was that by leveraging the distributed data processing capabilities of &lt;a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/&amp;amp;t=ODQwMzljZTFhMjE4MzZlNjUxNWQ5ZjFhYjE2Y2MwOGE1OGE4YzFmNSxaVU4zS00wOQ%3D%3D"&gt;Apache Hadoop&lt;/a&gt;, and combining them with Intel’s breadth of infrastructure experience, we could make Big Data analytics more accessible and therefore more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Smaller, single-purpose, atomic functions core ingredient of tomorrow’s computing</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/smaller-single-purpose-atomic-functions-core-ingredient-of-tomorrow-computing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:40:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/smaller-single-purpose-atomic-functions-core-ingredient-of-tomorrow-computing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had a chance to attend the 3rd AWS re:invent conference in Vegas.

&lt;p&gt;Talking to people at &lt;a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-eu"&gt;Strata this week&lt;/a&gt; only confirmed for me that in the midst of what can only be described as virtual gluttony of open-source software, there is massive number of organizations who find it increasingly harder to implement these technologies.

&lt;p&gt;As I was considering the pros and cons of each option, I realized the apparent shift in my personal attitude towards cloud data storage over last few years. My concerns used to be solely with security. Now, while the data security is still critical, I am much more interested in data access, ownership, integration and its control.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Data Opportunities, 3 Areas to Focus Innovation</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/data-opportunities-3-areas-to-focus-innovation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 00:33:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/data-opportunities-3-areas-to-focus-innovation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half ago, I wrote about &lt;a href="https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/3-killer-big-data-app-opportunities.md"&gt;Big Data Opportunities&lt;/a&gt;, focusing primarily on Leveraging Unused Data, Driving New Value From Summary Data and Harnessing Heterogeneous Data Sensors (more recently known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things"&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that post, data space has exploded with numerous solutions addressing many of these areas. These solutions while mostly based on batch operations and limited to serial MapReduce jobs against frequently off-line, inadequately secured, Hadoop cluster, they do allow access to previously inaccessible data.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PaaS not just about runtime, data services are the next differentiator</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/paas-not-just-about-runtime-data-services-are-the-next-differentiator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 00:30:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/paas-not-just-about-runtime-data-services-are-the-next-differentiator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In general, Platform as a Service (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service&amp;amp;t=YzdiYWU1Yjc0MTdkMzZiMzM3N2NjN2I0MTNmMDk0ZDhlYTBiNzk1YixZY0ltODJRaQ%3D%3D"&gt;PaaS&lt;/a&gt;) is developed by developers for developers.
