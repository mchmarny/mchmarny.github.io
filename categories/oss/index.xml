While both of these services have search options, neither of these seem to be advanced enough to narrow my searches at the desired level or to setup automatic delivery.</description></item><item><title>How I learned Dapr building tweet sentiment processing pipeline</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-i-learned-dapr-building-tweet-sentiment-processing-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:05:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-i-learned-dapr-building-tweet-sentiment-processing-pipeline/</guid><description>I recently joined the Office of CTO in Azure at Microsoft and wanted to ramp up on one of the open source projects the team has built there called Dapr. Dapr describes itself as:
A portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.</description></item><item><title>How to debug container image content</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-debug-container-image-content/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 22:20:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-debug-container-image-content/</guid><description>When dealing with file permissions in a non-root image or building apps that include static content (like css or templates), I sometime get an error resulting from the final image content mismatch with my expectations.
Most of the time the errors are pretty obvious, simple fix and rebuild will do.</description></item><item><title>My preso on Knative - Serverless on Your Own Terms at Cloud Conf 2019</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-serverless-on-your-own-terms-at-cloud-conf-2019-turin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 02:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-serverless-on-your-own-terms-at-cloud-conf-2019-turin/</guid><description>That was a lot of fun. The conference has double its audience from last year, had a spectacular venue, and large selection of topics.
I spoke in the #serverless track on using Knative as a means to serverless where you want it and on your own terms.</description></item><item><title>Knative momentum continues…</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-momentum-continues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2018 19:02:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-momentum-continues/</guid><description>I wrote a new post on Google blog on the momentum behind the Knative project. How it the community reached another adoption milestone, doubling the number of its contributors. Also, another data point underscoring the Knative momentum is the month-over-month contributions which have increased over 45% since the 0.</description></item><item><title>Build, deploy, manage modern serverless workloads using Knative on Kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/build-deploy-manage-modern-serverless-workloads-using-knative-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 16:05:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/build-deploy-manage-modern-serverless-workloads-using-knative-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>By now, Kubernetes should be the default target for your deployments. Yes, there are still use-cases where Kubernetes is not the optimal choice, but these represent an increasingly smaller number of modern workloads.
The main value of Kubernetes is that it greatly abstracts much of the infrastructure management pain.</description></item><item><title>HDFS has won, now de facto standard for centralized data storage</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/hdfs-has-won-de-facto-standard-for-centralized-data-storage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:28:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/hdfs-has-won-de-facto-standard-for-centralized-data-storage/</guid><description>The “high-priests” of Big Data have spoken. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is now the de facto standard platform for data storage. You may have heard this “heresy” uttered before. But, for me, it wasn’t until the recent Strata conference that I began to really understand how prevalent this opinion actually is.</description></item><item><title>Data-related investments shift from tech to skills — talent new differentiator</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/data-related-investments-shift-from-tech-to-skills-talent-new-differentiator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:24:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/data-related-investments-shift-from-tech-to-skills-talent-new-differentiator/</guid><description>Over the last decade, the access to best-of-bread data technologies has become easier. This is due mainly to the increasing popularity of open source software (OSS). While this phenomenon holds true in other areas like operating systems, application servers, development frameworks or even monitoring tools, it is perhaps most prevalent in the area of data.</description></item><item><title>Gluttony of great open ML tools too hard for enterprise to use</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/gluttony-of-open-machine-intelligence-software-enterprise-finds-hard-to-use/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 11:40:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/gluttony-of-open-machine-intelligence-software-enterprise-finds-hard-to-use/</guid><description>Seems like every week we hear about yet another new open source Machine/Deep Learning library or Analytical Framework.
Talking to people at Strata this week only confirmed for me that in the midst of what can only be described as virtual gluttony of open-source software, there is massive number of organizations who find it increasingly harder to implement these technologies.</description></item></channel></rss>
