Dapr describes itself as:
A portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.</description></item><item><title>My preso on Knative - Serverless on Your Own Terms at Cloud Conf 2019</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-serverless-on-your-own-terms-at-cloud-conf-2019-turin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 02:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-serverless-on-your-own-terms-at-cloud-conf-2019-turin/</guid><description>That was a lot of fun.

How it the community reached another adoption milestone, doubling the number of its contributors. Also, another data point underscoring the Knative momentum is the month-over-month contributions which have increased over 45% since the 0.</description></item><item><title>Knative at SpringOne</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-at-springone/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 18:59:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-at-springone/</guid><description>I had an opportunity to keynote at this year’s SpringOne conference in DC on Serverless, Kubernetes, and more specifically Knative.
I also covered the great work our open source team at Google been doing, making Spring 1st class citizen on Google Cloud Platform.</description></item><item><title>Build, deploy, manage modern serverless workloads using Knative on Kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/build-deploy-manage-modern-serverless-workloads-using-knative-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 16:05:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/build-deploy-manage-modern-serverless-workloads-using-knative-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>By now, Kubernetes should be the default target for your deployments. Yes, there are still use-cases where Kubernetes is not the optimal choice, but these represent an increasingly smaller number of modern workloads.
The main value of Kubernetes is that it greatly abstracts much of the infrastructure management pain.</description></item><item><title>Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Go using Google NLP API</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/twitter-sentiment-analysis-in-go-using-google-nlp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2017 17:26:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/twitter-sentiment-analysis-in-go-using-google-nlp/</guid><description>As part of my ramp up on Google APIs I wanted to create a project that would allow me some practical exercise in a context of a real application.

I’m not a big fan of that city myself, but, as in previous years, re:invent has not disappointed.
