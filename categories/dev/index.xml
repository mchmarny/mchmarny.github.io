You trust that the person behind the commit is who they claim to be, that their account hasn&amp;rsquo;t been compromised, and that their contribution is genuine. Most of the time, that trust is warranted. But supply chain attacks like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor"&gt;xz utils backdoor&lt;/a&gt; remind us that trust without verification is a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Provenance, transparency, and context, the three aspects of software supply chain security you can implement today</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/provenance-transparency-context-3-aspects-of-s3c-you-can-implement-today/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 08:57:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/provenance-transparency-context-3-aspects-of-s3c-you-can-implement-today/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The practice of Secure Software Supply Chain (S3C) can get complex at times. Fortunately though, a large portion of the key things we can do to secure our software delivery pipelines are actually pretty easy. This post covers three concepts you can implement today:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Software supply chain data fatigue and what I’ve learned from SBOM, vulnerability reports</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/automating-software-supply-chain-security/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 07:09:34 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/automating-software-supply-chain-security/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you are doing any vulnerability detection in your software release pipeline today, you are already familiar with the volumes of data these scanners can generate. That dataset gets significantly larger when you add things like license scanning and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom"&gt;Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt; (SBOM) generation. That volume of data gets further compounded with each highly-automated pipeline you operate. This can quickly lead to what I refer to as a Software Supply Chain Security (S3C) data fatigue, as many vulnerabilities you’ll discover you simply can’t do anything about. There is an actionable signal in there actually, it’s just hard to find it in the midst of all the noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reproducible OpenID connect to GCR for GitHub Actions workflows using Terraform</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/reproducible-github-workflow-openid-connect-for-gcp-using-terraform/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 16:12:38 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/reproducible-github-workflow-openid-connect-for-gcp-using-terraform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The recently introduced by GitHub support for &lt;a href="https://openid.net/connect/"&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/a&gt; (OIDC) tokens in &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; allows workflows to mint new tokens and then exchange those tokens for short-lived OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to access and manage Cloud resources. This is all done without the need to store the traditional long-lived service account keys in a form of GitHub secrets.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Multi Region REST Service on GCP using GitHub Template</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/multi-region-rest-service-on-gcp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 15:43:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/multi-region-rest-service-on-gcp/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I learn best by doing. And recently, most of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been building are either REST or gRPC-base services deployed as container images into Cloud Run on GCP. That means that I increasingly find myself recreating a lot of the same infra and app deployment flows.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Medium to GitHub using Hugo - Why and How I Migrated my Blog</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/medium-to-hugo-why-and-how/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 13:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/medium-to-hugo-why-and-how/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-not-medium"&gt;Why not Medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main reason for migrating off Medium was the &lt;a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017581433-About-the-metered-paywall"&gt;paywall&lt;/a&gt; Medium introduced while back. I actually understand why they did it. The unlimited access price: $5/month ($50/year) is too high, but still, I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me though, the objective was to allow readers to easily discover and read my posts. I don&amp;rsquo;t want my readers to experience any friction. Forcing the reader to deal with the frustrating Medium up-sell pop-ups just to read my post was just unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Custom news scraper using free services from GitHub, Firebase, and Sengrid</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/custom-news-scraper-using-free-services-from-github-firebase-sengrid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 01:09:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/custom-news-scraper-using-free-services-from-github-firebase-sengrid/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing large amount of technical news I read come from the posts shared on Hacker News or on Twitter. While both of these services have &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-advanced-search"&gt;search options&lt;/a&gt;, neither of these seem to be advanced enough to narrow my searches at the desired level or to setup automatic delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I learned Dapr building tweet sentiment processing pipeline</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-i-learned-dapr-building-tweet-sentiment-processing-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:05:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-i-learned-dapr-building-tweet-sentiment-processing-pipeline/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently joined the Office of CTO in Azure at Microsoft and wanted to ramp up on one of the open source projects the team has built there called Dapr. Dapr &lt;a href="https://dapr.io/"&gt;describes itself&lt;/a&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time the errors are pretty obvious, simple fix and rebuild will do. Sometimes though, you want to take a look into the image and understand what the actual layout looks like in there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to run containerized workloads in GCE VM</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-run-containerized-workloads-in-gce-vm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2019 22:10:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-run-containerized-workloads-in-gce-vm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While the idea of a serverless platform and long running workloads does seem somewhat &amp;ldquo;unnatural&amp;rdquo; at first, smart people are already working on that (looking at you &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/KnativeProject"&gt;@Knative&lt;/a&gt; community).

These button caught my attention because they can include triggers for single, double, or hold click and can be easily wired up to all kinds of actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I instantly thought of of a few really interesting applications. To start with though, I wanted to create a simple service that would allow me to push the custom data defined on each button over HTTP to Cloud PubSub. That in turn would then connect me to the many more actuation options through GCP APIs and services that connect to Cloud PugSub.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Knative - Serverless on Your Own Terms</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-serverless-on-your-own-terms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 02:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/knative-serverless-on-your-own-terms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I had a chance to speak at the Cloud Conf 2019 in Turin, Italy. The conference has double its audience from last year, had a spectacular venue, and large selection of topics. I spoke in the #serverless track on using Knative as a means to serverless where you want it and on your own terms.

Yes, there are still use-cases where Kubernetes is not the optimal choice, but these represent an increasingly smaller number of modern workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main value of Kubernetes is that it greatly abstracts much of the infrastructure management pain. The broad support amongst virtually all major Cloud Service Providers (CSP) also means that your workloads are portable. Combined with the already vibrant ecosystem of Kubernetes-related tools, means that the experience of the operator, the person responsible for managing Kubernetes, is now pretty smooth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to use Stackdriver to monitor custom application metrics</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-use-stackdriver-to-monitor-custom-application-metrics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2017 22:08:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/how-to-use-stackdriver-to-monitor-custom-application-metrics/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/"&gt;Stackdriver&lt;/a&gt; has thousands of build-in metrics to monitor everything from Kubernetes cluster to database or storage.

&lt;p&gt;To test even the validity of this approach I put together a Go app that subscribes to Twitter stream for all companies defined in the &lt;code&gt;Stocks&lt;/code&gt; table and scores each event against the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/"&gt;Google NLP API&lt;/a&gt; while comparing the user sentiment against the stock ask price against Yahoo API.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Go using Google NLP API</title><link>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/twitter-sentiment-analysis-in-go-using-google-nlp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2017 17:26:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.chmarny.com/posts/twitter-sentiment-analysis-in-go-using-google-nlp/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my ramp up on Google APIs I wanted to create a &lt;a href="https://github.com/mchmarny/tfeel"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; that would allow me some practical exercise in a context of a real application.&lt;/p&gt;
